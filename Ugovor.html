 <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">This is a legal agreement between the subscriber (“you”), and BMW of North America, LLC (“BMW”),
governing the provision of BMW Assist Services to your BMW vehicle. Whether or not you have signed this agreement, by activating and using the BMW Assist Services, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement.

BMW Assist Services.</b> BMW will provide, through its authorized subcontractor
(“ATX”), the mobile monitoring and support services (“BMW Assist Services”) included in the Service Plan. A description of the BMW Assist Services appears in your vehicle’s owner’s manual and in the informational
brochure available from the BMW Assist Response Center upon request. BMW and ATX reserve the right, without prior notice, to add, change or delete services included in the BMW Assist Services provided to you. ATX may also withhold Services, or may
use the Services to locate the BMW vehicle, if ATX reasonably believes that you are not the lawful owner or lessee of the vehicle. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">2. <b>Wireless Services</b>. BMW Assist Services uses commercial mobile wireless services purchased from one or more third party providers (the “Underlying Wireless
Carrier”). This agreement does not give you any rights against the Underlying Wireless Carrier selected for the BMW Assist Services. The Underlying Wireless Carrier is, however, an intended third party beneficiary of the protections of this
agreement. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">3. <b>Service Limitations</b>. The BMW Assist Services are provided
by BMW through ATX, using an embedded telematics device installed in your vehicle (the “BMW Assist Unit”), which receives global positioning satellite (GPS) signals and communicates with the response center via wireless and landline
communications networks. The BMW Assist Unit does not have the ability to receive calls and may only place calls to ATX as permitted under this agreement. The availability and use of BMW Assist Services are subject to many limitations, including the
following: (a) Services are available only if you have filled out, signed and submitted the BMW Assist subscriber agreement and the BMW Assist Response Center has received the agreement; (b) Services are available only if your vehicle ignition is
on, and your vehicle battery is charged and connected; (c) Services are available only within the 50 United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, (d) Services are available only when the BMW Assist Unit is in range of a transmission site of the Underlying
Wireless Carrier, or a transmission site of another company that has agreed to carry its calls, and there is sufficient network capacity at that moment; (e) Services will not be available if the wireless network requires the use of PIN codes; (f)
Services may be impaired by land-line and wireless communications problems caused by atmospheric or topographical conditions, busy cells, capacity limitations, equipment problems, equipment maintenance, and other factors and conditions; (g)There are
places, particularly in remote areas, with no service at all from the Underlying Wireless Carrier; (h) Services may be affected by inherent limitations of your vehicle’s electrical system and architecture, or if any of the components of your
vehicle’s BMW Assist Unit have been damaged or are defective; (i) Services are not available if the GPS system is not working (map CD or DVD may be required) or the signals are obstructed; (j) Certain programming limitations of the GPS system
may impair ATX’s ability to determine your vehicle’s precise location; (k) Services may be limited to geographic areas where map data and emergency (911) contact information is available in ATX’s databases, which may be less than that
which is otherwise generally available; and (l) Your BMW Assist Unit uses either analog or digital cellular telephone signals. If the Underlying Wireless Carrier terminates or restricts analog or digital service, the BMW Assist Services may not be
available. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">4. <b>Terminating or Transferring BMW Assist Services</b>. You or a
subsequent owner of your vehicle may terminate your account for BMW Assist Services to your vehicle, upon submission of proper documentation to ATX. If you sell your vehicle during the initial “BMW-paid period” of Service, the new owner
may assume the remaining “BMW-paid period” of Service. If you have prepaid for Services and sell your vehicle, you may apply to ATX for a prorated refund (subject to a $25 cancellation fee), but you may not transfer the prepayment to a new
owner of your vehicle. If you sell your vehicle, notify BMW Assist Customer Care at 1-888-333-6118. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">5. <b>Your Duties</b>.

properly maintain your vehicle and the BMW Assist Unit; (f) not use the BMW Assist Services in violation of any laws or for any unlawful or abusive purpose; (g) not use the BMW Assist Services in any manner unintended by ATX, BMW, or the Underlying
Wireless Carrier; (h) not use the BMW Assist Services in any manner that could harm ATX, BMW, the Underlying Wireless Carrier, or any other person; (i) use the map, routing and traffic information or other content included in the BMW Assist Services
only for your own personal use and not resell, retransmit or modify the information and content; and (j) comply with any other reasonable requirements or restrictions requested or imposed by BMW, ATX or the Underlying Wireless Carrier. </font></p>

on this agreement. This agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms, unless you or BMW provides notice of cancellation to the other party at least 15 days before the beginning of the next renewal term. You may cancel
service either by sending a written cancellation notice to ATX at 8550 Freeport Parkway, Irving, TX 75063 or by calling BMW Assist Customer Care at 1-888-333-6118. You will need your password to cancel service. ATX will send written notice to you at
least 45 days before the beginning of any renewal term, or if BMW is changing the subscription fee or any of the BMW Assist Services included in your Service Plan. If you fail to timely deliver a cancellation notice, then your BMW Assist Services
will continue and you will be charged for another year. If you elect not to renew this agreement, you will not have access to any of the BMW Assist Services. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">7. <b>Subscription Fee</b>. The subscription fee for the Service Plan you have selected is payable in advance of the renewal term. The subscription fee is refundable as
described in section four (4) of the terms and conditions of this agreement. For any late payment you may be charged a $5.00 late fee. By providing your credit card number, you authorize ATX, on behalf of BMW, to charge your account for all fees,
taxes and other amounts due under this agreement. Having your credit card information on file ensures the continuity of your BMW Assist Safety and Convenience Services at the end of the BMW-paid period. Your credit card information is 128-bit SSL
encrypted during transmission, using the highest security services available.

telecommunications taxes, and all other taxes, fees and charges imposed on you, ATX, BMW, the Underlying Wireless Carrier or the BMW Assist Unit manufacturer, in connection with the purchase and installation of the BMW Assist Unit and the provision
and use of the BMW Assist Services. The taxes, fees and charges will be added to your bill. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">9. <b>Termination or Modification for Excessive Use</b>. If ATX determines that your usage of the BMW Assist Services is so excessive that it interferes or could interfere with ATX’s ability to provide timely,
high-quality telematics services to its other subscribers, or if ATX determines that your usage constitutes a nuisance or is otherwise not consistent with the terms of this agreement, then ATX may in its discretion suspend, modify or terminate the
BMW Assist Services provided to you, without any advance notice. These rights are in addition to those in “Default and Termination” below. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">10. <b>Responsibility in Emergency Situations</b>. When ATX receives an emergency signal from your vehicle, ATX will attempt to determine if an emergency exists. If ATX
determines that an emergency exists, ATX will attempt to contact the appropriate public safety access point to request assistance. ATX may also attempt to call one of your third party emergency contacts. Neither ATX nor BMW guarantee that ATX will
actually receive an emergency signal or call from your vehicle or that ATX will successfully contact the appropriate emergency agency or your third party emergency contacts if it does receive an emergency signal or call, or that emergency personnel
will respond to the call or locate your vehicle. Neither ATX, nor BMW nor the Underlying Wireless Carrier is responsible for any failure or delay in responding to an emergency or for the quality of service delivered, whether the failure is the fault
of ATX, BMW, the Underlying Wireless Carrier or any other third party service provider. You release ATX, BMW, the Underlying Wireless Carrier and any other third party service providers from all liabilities and losses (including physical injury or
death) that you or others may suffer in an emergency situation. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">11. <b>Default
and Termination</b>. If you fail to timely pay any amount due under this agreement, BMW may terminate this agreement upon 10 days written notice to you. If you breach any other term of this agreement, BMW may terminate this agreement upon 30 days
written notice to you. These rights are in addition to any others ATX or BMW may have. If ATX or BMW brings an action to enforce its rights against you, you agree to pay all reasonable costs of enforcement, including attorneys’ fees. IF BMW
TERMINATES THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE BMW ASSIST SERVICES, AND YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND OR CREDIT. </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="1"> </font></p> <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><font size="2">12. <b>Force Majeure</b>.
